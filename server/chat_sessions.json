I encourage you not to do so, because this is a very important part in your trading plan - it sets the scene for your trading and gives it direction. As a trader you are responsible for all your decisions and actions in the market. Successful traders have sound business plans with clear goals and objectives, setting out why they want to be a trader and what they are trying to achieve.\n\nUSER QUESTION:\nwhy is a trading plan important"

Without clear goals, you're like a ship without a rudder, tossed about by the market's whims. Setting achievable objectives is paramount, especially given your current win rate. Discipline and a well-defined plan are your best defenses against the storm."
