The cheapest brokerage for share trading is a fixed cost of approximately $19.95 per trade for trades under $10 000. So to buy and sell, you are looking at a total of about $40 per trade. At $40 a trade, this would equate to 1.6 per cent of a $2500 trade. So you would require a share to rise by 1.6 per cent just to pay off the brokerage costs of the trade. The smaller the amount invested, the larger the rise you would require to pay for brokerage. This makes it harder to make a profit.",

For example, 20 per cent return on a $100 000 account would provide an income of $20 000 - would this be enough to replace your income? Probably not.

However, what they don't realise is that if they had let those five profitable trades run, they might have been surprised by the results.

You need to consider what timeframe you want to trade, because being a day trader is very different to being a long-term investor. It is all about how frequently you want to trade and how long you would like to hold trades open for. There is no right or wrong - the style you select must be one that you are comfortable with and that suits your personality and lifestyle.",

The height of each line tells you the number of shares that were traded for the day - the longer the line, the more shares changed hands that day.",

Liquid stocks have strong demand, meaning there are a lot of buyers and sellers available at each price level and they have high volume each day, making it easier to buy and sell a share. Illiquid shares lack demand and have only a few buyers or sellers available, making the shares harder to buy or sell at the price you want.",

I believe it is best to own stocks that you can easily enter and exit with a readily available supply of buyers and sellers in the market. All blue chip stocks trade in the millions per day, while small speculative stocks may only trade a few thousand a day. I personally prefer to trade within the top 300 stocks of the Australian market to ensure that there is always sufficient liquidity available on the share.",

When a share is healthy and in an uptrend, this is supported when volume increases as the price rises and decreases as the price falls.

When a share consolidates sideways, buyers and sellers are in equilibrium so volume tends to decrease during this time. Volume usually picks up before prices rise and then increases sharply when it breaks out of its trading range, giving an entry signal and showing that buyers are behind the new move.",
